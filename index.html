        <h1>Hi there!</h1>

        <h2>I'm Janelle</h2>
    </div>

  <div id="all">
      <p>I have a very long story but I'm sure you'd rather hear the short version. 
    So, here you go! I'm from Montgomery, Alabama but I've been living in Atlanta 
    since 2014. I have a long history of customer service/food and beverage/hospitality 
    experience (about 15 years!). As you could probably imagine, the service industry 
    can be challenging to say the least and I'm ready to jump into a career in which no 
    one will have to ask to speak to my manager over an incorrect lunch special. I have 
    a little bit of experience with the basics of web development but for the most part, 
    I'm still a newbie. I'm super excited to work with you all and gain the skills necessary
    to get one of those magical developer positions I keep hearing about. I still have a lot 
    to learn. For one, why in the world can't I get this picture to the right of this page???
    Anyway, be prepared for all of my annoying questions! There will certainly be several. </p>
